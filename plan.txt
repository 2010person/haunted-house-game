Plan -
- Centered around Napolean
- He is imprisoned in the back garden
- Generals Bertrand and Montholon stayed with Napolean until the end (they are the ghosts in level 10 and are briefly encountered in level 5)
- After level 10, move onto part 2, contains fighting. 
- Level 10 ends with the accidental release of Napolean's soul.
- Generals Bertrand and Montholon then reappear in Part 2 for the battle
- Napolean calls on the help of Hades, Lord of the Underworld
- Napolean wakes Hades by getting mortal blood from you and putting it into the ground.
- Napolean and Hades' new zombie army alliance can only be defeated by finding the three "objects" hiiden by the 1st Duke of Wellington (who first defated him)
- You are able to enlist on the help of Zeus and Posiedon and their armies, to win the battle. 
- This is because only they can transport you to find the three objects lethal to Napolean, put Hades back into slumber and have the armies to counter
  Napolean and Hades'.
